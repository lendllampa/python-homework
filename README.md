# Unit 2 | Homework Assignment: Automate Your Day Job with Python

## About
For the assignment, I am given a [budget_data.csv](PyBank/budget_data.csv) file that holds the month to month Profit and Losses of a bank. My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

1. The total number of months in the dataset.
2. The net total of Profit/Losses over the time period.
3. The average change in Profit/Losses over the time period.
4. The Greatest Increase in Profit/Losses over the time period.
5. The Greatest Decrease in Profit/Losses over the time period.

## The Expected Results
Python should calculate the results to reflect the following:

Total Months: 86\
Total: $38382578\
Average  Change: $-2315.12\
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)\
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
